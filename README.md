# Example code which replicates JWTSRV (Barunik and Vacha, 2015 QF) and JWTSCV (Barunik and Vacha, 2018 JFM) methods and is applied in Barunik and Fiser 2019. The main advantage of the wavelet-based estimation is the ability of wavelets to precisely separate the continuous price process into continuous and discontinuous parts even when data are covered with noise. For more details about the method see (Barunik and Vacha, 2018 JFM).
# The code has been developed in R version 3.5.0.
# For example code see OneDayEzample/OneDayExample.Rmd file
